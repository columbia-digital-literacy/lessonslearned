Mobile apps
Hybrid, or Native

Hybrid 
Usually built with a combination of languages for multiple platforms. Unlike native, hybrid apps don’t need separate efforts for each different mobile platform.

Advantages:
Devs are not locked into one OS 
Their portable – one code base for multiple platforms
Has access to various hardware/software capabilities (through plug-ins)
Cheaper
Faster to market

Drawbacks:
Complex apps are better suited for native
Development requires additional time and effort to mimic the native look and feel
App stores can reject hybrids if they don’t act fluidly


Native
An application built for a single mobile platform that is installed on the users device

Advantages:
Better UI/UX for the customer
Easier discovery
Access to device hardware/softwear (Location services, gyroscope, calendar. Etc.)
Better security 
Best performance
Offline mode

Drawbacks:
Can be very expensive to develop 
Not easy to coordinate the development for multiple platforms
Incredibly time consuming
Can be tough to build traction in all of the different app stores
