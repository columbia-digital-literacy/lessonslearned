###What is GitHub and How we can use it?             
+ GitHub is a website where you can upload a copy of your Git repository. It allows you to collaborate much more easily with other people on a project. 

###Why people use GitHub ? 
+ Document requirements/ Collaborate on independent streams of history/ Review work in progress/ See team progress
  in the class,
+ We learned how and why people use GitHub to collaborate.
+ We saw the status of a project—recent changes, outstanding work, and historic changes
+ We created and edited files through GitHub without deep understanding about the professional development
+ We used tools like issues, pull requests, and branches to specify and collaborate on changes
+ We created a new GitHub repository to control who has access to our project
+ GitHub is like Wikipedia for programmers. You can access, view and even edit files. 
+ Companies mainly use it to build software and web applications, whereas individuals use it to browse, find and share projects.
+ GitHub allows you to host your projects on their server and version control it using the git version control software. 
+ GitHub provides one user page and unlimited project pages. So, you can host a static website about you or like me you can create a    simple game using HTML, CSS, JS.
+ Collaborate with other developers and contribute to Open Source Projects. I know most open source projects 
  are big in terms of code base but if you want to get started here's a simple project that I contributed to.
