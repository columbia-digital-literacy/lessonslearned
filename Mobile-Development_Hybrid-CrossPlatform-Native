The process of developing a mobile application differs a bit from creating a standard website.
Although a site is often the best way to start in order to maximize reach and simplicity and minimize time to market and cost, eventually a mobile solution is likely to be necessary.
Each of the following 3 approaches to creating applications has pros and cons that make it suited for different situations.


1.	Hybrid Application Development: uses web programming languages in a set tool to create a standalone mobile application

Pros: Can leverage existing web content, uses a single code base across devices, has the quickest time to market

Cons: Limited functionality for hardware features, less flexibility with user interface, and slower performance

Best for: content-driven applications (e.g. news) and/or those that need to be made quickly and cheaply


2.	Cross-Platform Application Development: uses specific web programming languages that can then be translated into files that can be read on different mobile platforms

Pros: Single code base, more cost effective for multiple platforms than native programming, allows for deep hardware integration, quicker to market than native application

Cons: Might require a licensing fee, less flexibility with user interface and user experience than native programming, will require lag time to integrate many native hardware features

Best for: Standard application types (e.g. shopping) and/or those that need more integration than Hybrid but perhaps with a shorter time frame or smaller budget than a native


3.	Native Application Development: uses languages specifically developed for each platform to create applications for each platform

Pros: Best performance, can take full advantage of hardware and third party integration, future-proof (operating system updates, for example), the only option for games and other immersive applications

Cons: Most expensive, slowest to market, and requires a team for each platform

Best for: Immersive applications (e.g.games) and/or applications that will benefit from integration with hardware that have enough time and budget to build it
