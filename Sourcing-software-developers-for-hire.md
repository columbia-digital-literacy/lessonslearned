## Ways to Source Software Developers for Hire

- Ask other developers you may know for advice about potential candidates
  - Pesonal referrals prove to work very well
- Seek out developers who post on blogs or who present at conferences, as it will help you to find individuals with both expertise and communication skills
- Post on relevant mailing lists
- Observe credits on sites that are well-developed
- Seek out graduates from specialized universities (note that individuals may be less experienced)
- Attend hack-a-thons (note that participants may be younger and less experienced)
- You may choose to hire a developer from sites such as [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com), [Rent a Coder](http://www.rent-acoder.com), [Elance](https://www.elance.com/?r), or [Guru](http://www.guru.com)
  - Can potentially be more expensive
- Go to relevant meetups
  - An example of one such meetup is [NYC on Rails](http://www.meetup.com/nyc-on-rails/)
  - Upon speaking with people at meetings, give a very brief elevator pitch, let people know you can pay, and say something such as "do you know anyone who may be interested?" to avoid putting people on the spot


  *Follow this simple advice and you'll certainly find the perfect developer in no time!*
