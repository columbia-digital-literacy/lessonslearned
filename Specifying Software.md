We have to consider following factors to specify what software to use.
+ Specific OS
+ Features
+ Wire frames
+ Comp’s
+ User stories
+ User walk through
+ Data model
+ Non-functional specs
+ Business goals
+ Discussions with developers

Especially for User stories, we have to identify three things.
As a role, feature we want, so that benefit.
When explaining these things to developers, we have to be short and clear.
We have to be able to explain these on one small paper or post-it.
