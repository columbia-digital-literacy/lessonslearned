+I was not sure why people talked so much about big data and what is so big deal about it. I thought if your data doubles, why not put twice as many chips to handle it. 
+It was my aha moment when you mentioned that it takes far more magnitude of computation power to handle data when data gets bigger because there are rows and columns of data and computer needs to iterate through them every time user request specific type of information they want. 
+I was also very impressed how engineers came up with brilliant ideas, such as big table, to handle big data.

# How to identify a good programmer

It is extremely hard to find and hire a great programmer if you don't have any programming background. Because if you are not a programmer yourself, you don't know what to look for in programmers you want to hire.

Here're some tips that can give you some ideas when you need to find a good programmer:

+ Talk to your friends who are great developers and let them point you in the right direction. Ask them what technical questions to ask and what specific answers you need to look for.
+ Explore some venues where skilled developers spend their time. You will get a high chance to find talented programmers through tech conferences, universities, developer commmunities, blogs, and many other developer events.
+ Or, the last option could be making a contract with free-lancing developer through developer communities or websites. 
For example, 1. [Toptal.com] (http://www.toptal.com/developers) 2. [Freelancer.com](http://www.freelancer.com/hire/Programmer) 

Belows are some of characteristics that you could look for when you identify a great developer:
+ Early adopter and fast adapter - someone who loves try things out
+ Inquisitive developer who asks lots of questions
+ Critical thinker who likes to challenge existing thoughts
+ Realistic person who can gauge the underlying nature of problems
+ Jack of all trades: Keep abreast of new developments
