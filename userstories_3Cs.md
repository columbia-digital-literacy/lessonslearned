User Stories
A user story is not a requirements document. Developers should not be the ones writing user stories. A good user story should follow the INVEST guideline.
I = Independent
N = Negotiable
V = Valuable
E = Estimable
S = Small
T = Testable
An example of a user story : 
As a returning customer,
I want to see the order status,
So I can track when my shipment will be shipped and reach me.

The 3 C’s of user stories :
1.	The Card
It is typically a 4x6 index card on which a user story is written. The most optimal way to implement this is using Post-Its and Markers. 
The team would then have a whiteboard of user stories (works best if the teams are co-located). There are 3 columns : ToDo, Doing 
and Done. User stories start off in the "ToDo" column. They are moved to the “Doing” column when work is started and then to 
the “Done” column after they are completed. Prof. Bell mentioned in class that there are software packages that can help with 
the whiteboard of user stories. But he also mentioned that people love to physically move user stories from the “Doing” to the “Done” 
column because it gives the developer in question a sense of accomplishment.
2.	Conversation
In Agile, you don’t front-load specifications upfront. You deliver requirements Just-In-Time. This is done when it comes close 
to time to work on the new user story. It is achieved during a quick conversation with the client and the IT contact. 
Then the Product Manager asks the IT contact to send a 2-3 paragraph summary of the conversation to verify that it is correct. 
The informal conversations occur right before starting development and therefore is a very lightweight and efficient process.
3.	The Confirmation
This is achieved by Automated Acceptance Testing. The Product Manager can click through the website or application and confirm 
whether the behavior is what he/she expects. It is extremely important that when a developer asks a Product Manager to sign off 
on Acceptance tests, the Product Manager should confirm that the application is running on a staging server (which is production like) 
and not on the developer’s desktop.
