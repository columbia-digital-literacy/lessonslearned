#User Stories
A user story is not a requirements document. Developers should not be the ones writing user stories. A good user story should follow the INVEST guideline.
I = Independent
N = Negotiable
V = Valuable
E = Estimable
S = Small
T = Testable
A good user story has:
1. ROLE : The role that you are when you visit the website/application
2. FEATURE : Functionality that you want
3. BENEFIT : Benefit to the visitor (not for the company)
A user story follows the format:
   As a ROLE,
   I want FEATURE,
   So that BENFIT
An example of a user story follows: 
   As a returning customer,
   I want to see the order status,
   So I can track when my shipment will be shipped and reach me.

#The 3 C’s of user stories :
1.	The Card
It is typically a 4x6 index card on which a user story is written. Post-Its and Markers are optimal. The team would  have a whiteboard of user stories (works best if team is co-located). There are 4 columns : ToDo, Doing, Ready For Review and Done. User stories start off in the "ToDo" column. They are moved to the “Doing” column when work is started and to the “Ready for Review” column when they are ready to be reviewed by the Product Manager/Owner. After approval, user story is moved to "Done" column. Prof. Bell mentioned that people love to physically move user stories to the “Done”  column because it gives developers a sense of accomplishment.
Another useful column is "Obstacles" which gives a sense of an obstable/outside dependency that a developer faces. Both "Ready for Review" and "Obstacles" provide visibility and transparency to the Product Manager aand team. e.g. if the Ready for Review column has many post-its on it, Product Manager needs to start clearing the backlog of stories.
2.	Conversation
In Agile, you don’t front-load specifications upfront. You deliver requirements Just-In-Time. This is done when it comes close 
to time to work on the new user story. It is achieved during a quick conversation with the client and the IT contact. 
Then the Product Manager asks the IT contact to send a 2-3 paragraph summary of the conversation to verify that it is correct. 
The informal conversations occur right before starting development and therefore is a very lightweight and efficient process.
3.	The Confirmation
This is achieved by Automated Acceptance Testing. The Product Manager can click through the website or application and confirm 
whether the behavior is what he/she expects. It is extremely important that when a developer asks a Product Manager to sign off 
on Acceptance tests, the Product Manager should confirm that the application is running on a staging server (which is production like) 
and not on the developer’s desktop.
