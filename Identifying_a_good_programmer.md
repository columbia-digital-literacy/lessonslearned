+ In the beginning of start-up, looking for a good pragrammer is demanding.
+ I had an experience of asking friends, who have computor science backgrouds but it was not so successful.
+ The professor told us that going to Meet-Up events or looking for a developer's forum is valuable.
+ My start-up successfully figured out the CTO who has more or less 20 years experiences in Microsoft.
+ Comparing with pairs and simple test are quite efficient to identify a good programmer.
+ Learning about basic all kinds of Coding langauaes are so useful when you communicate with developers.
