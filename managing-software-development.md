# Methods for Managing Software Development: Agile/Scrum/Kanban

Another key takeaway from our class was learning best practices for managing teams of programmers and the software development process. 

We briefly discussed 3 methodologies and some of the benefits of each: Agile, Scrum, and Kanban. 

The greatest benefit of Agile is that it is an incremental system, allowing iterations of a project rather than blocking out of goals and fixed milestones ahead of time. Scrum and Kanban put this incremental principle to use. 

There is also a hybrid [“Scrum-ban”](http://kanbantool.com/kanban-library/scrumban/what-is-scrumban#.VstqMpMrLow) approach that we discussed in class, which is very practical in breaking larger projects down into smaller tasks that can be quickly tackled by individual team members or pairs. There are 2 elements to this approach. First, teams bucket out tasks into short and longer term time frames and then focus on the short-term tasks as shown below:

The Production Board piece of this is a helpful day-to-day management tool. Here’s a simple example of a Kanban production board, similar to what we discussed in class:

Each letter on the board is a concrete task that should not take more than a day or two. Each team member should not be assigned too many different tasks at once to avoid too much multi-tasking.  Where tasks are pooling a production board can tell a manager about the team’s progress and issues they might be facing. Too many ideas in the “back-log” or “to-do” columns might slow the team down. Don’t feel the need to keep every single idea on the board, good ideas will come back to you! The “Designing”/”Developing” (or “In-Progress” or “Doing”) columns should also not be too full. If anyone column seems to have all the tasks accumulating it, try to figure out what the bottle neck is and eliminate it. 

As tasks are shifted to the “Done” column, as a manager you should see incrementally added functionality each week. This will be an indication to you that your team is making progress!
