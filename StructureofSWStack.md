#Front End
###Web Based ![Angular](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/pic_angular.jpg) ![HTML5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg/120px-HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png)
- The most common and prolific language for front-end web development is JavaScript. All browsers (mobile and desktop based) can understand JavaScript. 
  - JavaScript is complementary to the languages used to deliver and format the actual content on the pages - i.e. HTML and CSS
- Most popular front-end frameworks are [Angular.JS](https://angularjs.org/) or [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). There are multiple others on top of these, such as Ember. 
- Best web pages/apps are designed to be responsive. This means that the layout of the web page is dynamic and changes to provide the best experience in all types of devices. One of the most popular frameworks for page layout is [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

###Mobile ![Xamarin](http://static.oschina.net/uploads/logo/xamarin_hdOiH.png)
- A developer can design a mobile app in three different ways:
  - Hybrid: This approach ensures a fast method to develop apps that work on multiple platforms (e.g. iOS and Android). Most of the app in this model is written in web languages (i.e. HTML/CSS and JavaScript). Some of the most popular ones are PhoneGap and Xamarin (which recently got acquired by MicrosofT)
  - Cross-platform: Products such as Appcelerator provide the IDE & SDKs to enable developers to write one code base which supports multiple platforms.
  - Native: The best for performance but worst for cost, this is the model where developer maintains separate code bases for each platform.

#Back End ![node.js](http://nodejs-cloud.com/img/128px/nodejs.png)
- This is the part of the SW stack that responds to request from the client side. It provides most of the essential functionality of connected SW.
- There are multiple different languages and framework that developers use for back-end development:
  - Languages: Python, JavaScript, Ruby are some of the most popular languages.
  - Frameworks: Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Django (Python) and Node.JS+express (JavaScript) are some of the most popular frameworks.
