I feel so happy to achieve a ton of learnings from the Digital Literacy class. As a student of engineering background, I always keep strong interest on high-tech industry. Currently mobile internet is so popular and has significantly changed people’s life within just a few years, and is sure to play a dominant role in the foreseeable future. As a result, I would like very much to dedicate to this fantastic industry. But pity to say, although I have some basic skills on coding from my undergraduate study, as I joined consulting right after graduation until coming to B-school, I’m never able to have real experience in actual technical projects and don’t have too much understanding about technology in business. The Digital class helped me make up the gap and opened a door for me to technical issues. I was able to know how to think of business related technical questions. For example, with limited budgets, how we should go in hiring technical talents. Whether we should start with website first or app first and what are the key consideration criteria, etc. Those are all common and practical questions that we may face in real scenarios. In my future career life, no matter as a professional investor in high tech industry, or as a start-up founder potentially in the longer term, I will try to keep what I’ve learned in mind and take advantage of them in my career.
