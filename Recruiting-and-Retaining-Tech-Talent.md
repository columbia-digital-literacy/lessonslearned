<title>Recruiting and Retaining Tech Talent</title>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>There are many ways to acquire tech talent—software engineers, programmers and developers.  Understanding your project’s constraints may determine the type of talent you need and how many resources you can allocate to getting the right person for the job.  This cost-benefit analysis may force you to evaluate the advantages of contract versus part-time versus full-time versus agency hiring.  The notes below outline the basic stages of the recruiting and hiring process and offer insights to best practices.</p>

<p>The four main stages of this process are as follows:</p>
<li>Sourcing</li>
<li>Filtering</li>
<li>Attracting</li>
<li>Retaining</li>

<H1>Sourcing</h1>
<p>There are many ways to identify talent.  The best way to attract A-player talent is to get referrals from other A-players in your network or already on your team.  Its generally understood that A-players prefer to surround themselves by other A-players and that’s very much true in the tech community.  You can post job descriptions via email lists or job blogs and you can visit communal working spaces and meet-ups. </P>

<p>Other sources of talent include universities (for graduate and undergraduate computer science students) or “rent-a-coder” hubs for contract work.</p>

<p>A major part of the sourcing stage is your pitch to potential employees.  Some tips here include:  emphasize once-removed requests (“Do you know anyone who might be interested?”), emphasize the pay (you can avoid wasting time with folks with unrealistic expectations), and offer “teaching” opportunities (the best programmers like to mentor).</p>

<H1>Filtering</h1>
<p>Now that you’ve identified potential candidates, it’s time to filter the candidates so that you can determine who will be the best fit.  The most basic filter strategy is the interview.  But to endure you’re getting exactly the talent you need, here are a few recommendations to improve the interview process.  The goal:  Assess the interviewees programming skills. (Make sure s/he can walk the walk and talk the talk.)</P>
<li>Make sure to include a project or test along with the interview </li>
<li>Review a portfolio of other work completed</li>
<li>Assess current work commitments to determine if the interviewee has bandwidth for your project</li>
<li>Review a portfolio of other work completed</li>
<li>Pair the interviewee up with another developer (maybe at one computer) to see how s/he works on a team</li>
<li>Conduct group interviews to see how well the interviewee fits with the current team</li>
<li>Be sure to use “open-ended questions” at all time to ensure you get the fullest responses from the interviewee</li>
	
<p>The following open ended questions may offer maximum insight to your interviews work flows and thought processes.  (X = (1) version control system, (2) unit test tool, and (3) framework)</p>
<li>What X did you use?</li>
<li>What did you compare it to?</li>
<li>Why did you make the selection?</li>

<h1>Attracting</h1>
<p>Now that you have identified your preferred candidate through sourcing and filtering the pool of potentials, its now time to make an offer and have it accepted.  At the “attracting stage”, your objective is to make the final sales pitch to convince your potential new employee to join the team.  As follows are recommendations for to make this pitch convincing:</p>
<li>Sell the perks and fringe benefits of your working environment—free food, flexible work environment, etc.</li>
<li>Sell the total compensation packing—salary, benefits, time off, etc.</li>
<li>Focus on how the work will be professional engaging and challenging, may offer professional grow, and the ability to grow a lead (e.g. leadership opportunities)</li>
<li>Advocate for the importance of the mission and the vision for the company. For startups, focus on the honor of being a founding member</li>
<li>Emphasize how much you need this person and are looking forward to working with them.</li>

<p>All the while, its important that you are credible and demonstrate that you know the market and will be a good teammate or boss.</p>

<h1>Retaining</p>
<p>Great leaders not only attract great teammates but they are also able to retain them.  Luckily, it isn’t rocket science.  For the most part, your objective is to fulfill the promises you made in the “attraction stage” (see list above). Here are a few additional tips for retaining (and engaging) your top tech talent:</p>
<li>Offer schedule of increasing compensation, bonuses, benefits, and non-financial incentives</li>
<li>Encourage employee to develop a sense of ownership by engaging the employee as a problem-solver and challenge his/her technical skills</li>

<li>Implement systems for regular feedback, professional growth plans and 1:1 meetings</li>
