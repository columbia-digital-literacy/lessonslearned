Using Agile Method for Software Development 

The word 'agile' indicates being flexible, quick and responsive to external changes. 

Within the 'Agile' Method, team members have to commit to something called 'Sprint.' A Sprint can be for example a week long or two weeks long.

Each sprint requires team members to dedicate their resources to completing 'User Stories." 
Each User Story represents a feature that encompasses some kind of benefit for the service. 
In order to complete a User Story, there should be a list of tasks that need to be taken care of. 

Assignees should be strictly designated and other details such as days needed to complete should be specified as well. 

Every day, there should be a casual stand-up meeting, or a daily scrum meeting for each and everyone to review what they did the day before, 
what they will be doing today, and if there are any roadblocks along the way. At the end of each sprint, the team should have a retrospective sprint review meeting 
to go over which User Stories have been completed and which have not. At the end of each sprint meeting, each member should then decide their goals for the following sprint. 

Agile, or Scrum Methodology provides an intuitive and simple visualization of who's doing what and how by dividing all the different tasks into 
To Do, Doing, and Done. This allows the team leader to look out for any bottleneckes in the development process.
