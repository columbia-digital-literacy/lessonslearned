Disrupting the status quo
The takeaway for disrupting the status quo is that innovation is the key. For a long time, industries are in a "status quo" because the 
industry has matured to a certain extent. For example, the traditional brick and mortar retailing companies have long done business in
such setting that buying apparel or books were only achieved through such channels. However, with the emergence of Amazon, many customers
have shifted their ways of purchasing such items. 
If the user experiences or products offered by Amazon was not good enough, Amazon would have faded in history. However, because the 
technology developed with cloud computing and web services, Amazon has enabled customers to get more satisfaction out of shopping
online then in b&m. Thus, the innovation in technology and the changing business environment forces the companies to adapt or to die. 
Another example would be Uber disrupting the taxi industry.
