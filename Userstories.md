#User Stories 
My biggest takeaway from the class was about using user stories in the spec writing process. 
I thought this was particularly helpful as it allows the software development process to remain relevant and targeted in terms of working on developing the most important user stories, but also allows clear communication with the engineers. It's interesting to note that user stories are specific to/originated with the Agile/Scrum methodolgy of software development.

There are **various definitions** of [user stories](https://www.google.com/#q=user+stories+definition) that exist. However, at the simplest level, a user story should be the following: 
- As a **role**
- I want **feature**
- So that **benefit**

For example (Yelp): As a **hungry person**, I want **to search for restaurants that are in my area**, so that **I can get dinner ASAP!**

A **good user story** should be characterized by the acronym INVEST:
- Independent
- Negotiable
- Valuable
- Estimatable
- Small
- Testable

**Process** of using a stories in the software development process: 

I loved the idea of putting user stories on a post-it (forcing you to simplify it to the most important/ basic level) and then when an engineer starts working on it, having a conversation around the user story in terms of how the software needs to perform and live along that story. 

**Prioritization:**

When we start thinking of user stories in our software, there are many that can come to mind. It's important to prioritize the ones that matter *most* and build those out first. 

**An example** of user stories broken down into 'INVEST" sized chunks: 
The yellow post-its are the actual user stories/ features that would be worked on by a developer; the release lines separate which features will be ready for which release. The orange and blue post-its provide structure through macro user stories.
