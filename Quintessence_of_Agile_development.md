Agile development is a software development methodology that entails a set of principles which serve as guidline for software development. This methodology emphasizes collaboration between cross-functional engineers or teams. It stresses the importance of adapative planning, evolutionary development, fast delivery and continuous, seamless improvement. Morever, it promotes flexiblitiy in responding to changes.

This methodology was proclaimed in The Agile Manifesto which was conceived in 2001 when 17 programmers convened at the Snowbird Resort, Utah to discuss lighter, faster methods for software development. 

[Agile principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

The Agile Manifesto is based on twelve principles:

Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
Working software is the principal measure of progress
Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
