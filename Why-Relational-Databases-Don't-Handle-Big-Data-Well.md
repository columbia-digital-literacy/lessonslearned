# Big Data

+I was not sure why people talked so much about big data and what is so big deal about it. I thought that if the amount of data doubles, we could handle the data with twice as many chips. 
+But it’s not the amount of data that’s important. It is how data is structured. Over time data got increasingly unstructured and traditional relational databases were not designed to handle these kinds. Relational databases required cost prohibitive computing power so people were not able to use big data efficiently.
+So engineers came up with brilliant ideas to handle big data. They are Document Based Store, Key Value Store, Wide Column Stre and Graph Store
