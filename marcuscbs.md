# Mobile App vs. Site 
Given the tremendous growth in the use of mobile devices, one of the key decisions for many businesses today is whether to establish a mobile app for users to download or a mobile website (or both). 
There are number of key components to consider when evaluating these options. 
It is important to look at your goals of the site or app and also cost/timing. 
Advantages mobile websites: 
In general, the first step in developing a mobile web presence is using a mobile optimized website, and then to develop an app later on.
If your goal is to reach a wide group of people or related to marketing, mobile website is going to be the better option as it is instantly available to web users and it can be accessed across a wide range of devices. Apps require users to download the app first before content can be viewed which will limit engagement as users are required to go through an extra step to access the content. 
Mobile sites can also be located more easily than apps, while apps are only visible on app stores. 
Mobile sites can be shared with others (you can link with social media for example), you can share link to site. Shareability also increase reach and visibility of your content. 
Mobile sites are usually less expensive to develop than a native app, especially if you are considering a presence across multiple platforms. 
Advantages of mobile apps: 
However an app is useful for targeted purposes – for example, if you are developing a game, an app is probably your best option. If your target users are going to be regularly accessing your content, an app is sometimes a good option as it allows people to save and customize their content. Mobile apps also allow you to access content offline, which is another positive. Also mobile apps allow for more interactivity and are better for gaming.
