1) Sourcing Questions
- Ask other developers for their recommendations for new developers - result is good referals and creating a sense of community
- Look for engineers who speak at conferences and meet ups
- Check Upwork/[Rent A Coder] (http://www.rent-acoder.com/)/Guru for recommedations 
- Go to Developer meet ups relating to the type of product you are looking to build (language, framework, industry etc)

2) Filtering
- How would you build XYZ?  Check the thought process behind decisions and ability to communicate complex topics/ideas
- What types of projects have you worked on?

Additional situationally dependent questions 
- FizzBuzz test - if a novice, ask the candidate to build a quick FizzBuzz program
- If you have a CTO or trusted developer, ask the candidate to pair with the developer, remote or otherwise, to write some code
- Tell the programmer that sustainable pace is important to you - don't want someone who is working more than 60 hrs/week
- Ask three questions about three things
    3 Questions
    1) What X do you use?
    2) What do you compare it with?
    3) Why did you select X?
    3 Things
    1) Version control system
    2) Unit test tools
    3) Framework

Another option, if you have the resources (cash) and need to build something quickly is to use an agency to hire developer talent for a specified project. This can be an especially good option if you have someone inhouse who can analyze code, but may not have the times/expertise to build it in house. When utilizing this option, look to pay on a per project/feature basis as opposed to a per hour basis to maximize the return on your capital spent.  Also, make sure to set up regular (weekly) demos through the agency to monitor progress and iterate or change course if necessary.

3) Attracting 
- Show your added value: Be credible and don't flake
- Know your market inside out
- Offer growth and the chance for them to interact with customers
- Offer them the ability to grow a team/select new programmers
4) Retaining 
- Keep doing what you did to attract them
- Develope a personal growth plan
- Create a "programmer friendly" culture/vibe
- Offer Office and life perks
- Offer flexibility in schedule and working locations
- Allocate 80% of time to new features and 20% of time to fixing broken windows
- Give recognition and experiences as rewards, not cash
