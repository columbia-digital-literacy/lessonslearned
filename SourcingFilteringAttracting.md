1) Sourcing Questions
- Ask other developers for their recommendations for new developers - result is good referals and creating a sense of community
- Look for engineers who speak at conferences and meet ups
- Check Upwork/[Rent A Coder] (http://www.rent-acoder.com/)/Guru for recommedations 
- Go to Developer meet ups relating to the type of product you are looking to build (language, framework, industry etc)

2) Filtering
- How would you build XYZ?  Check the thought process behind decisions and ability to communicate complex topics/ideas
- What types of projects have you worked on?

Additional situationally dependent questions 
- FizzBuzz test - if a novice, ask the candidate to build a quick FizzBuzz program
- If you have a CTO or trusted developer, ask the candidate to pair with the developer, remote or otherwise, to write some code
- Tell the programmer that sustainable pace is important to you - don't want someone who is working more than 60 hrs/week
- Ask three questions about three things
    3 Questions
    1) What X do you use?
    2) What do you compare it with?
    3) Why did you select X?
    3 Things
    1) Version control system
    2) Unit test tools
    3) Framework
3) Attracting 
- Show your added value: Be credible and don't flake
- Know your market inside out
- Offer growth and the chance for them to interact with customers
- Offer them the ability to grow a team/select new programmers
4) Retaining 
- Keep doing what you did to attract them
- Develope a personal growth plan
- Create a "programmer friendly" culture/vibe
- Offer Office and life perks
- Offer flexibility in schedule and working locations
- Allocate 80% of time to new features and 20% of time to fixing broken windows
- Give recognition and experiences as rewards, not cash
