The Agile Manifesto

Flexibility
 . In a fast changing environment, requirements change frequently. Or worse, requirements are unclear at the beginning. 
 . Waterfall method is too rigid to incorporate changes in a timely fashion
 . Agile, with its small incremental releases, offer flexibility to meet changing needs.
 
Transparency
 . Even those not directly involved in the development process can appraise the current situation.
 . It is clear at all times who is working on what and how it is progressing thereby improving accountability.
 . Transparency allows for more detailed and accurate understanding of the development process thus reducing project overruns in terms of both time and money.
 
Business Focus
 . At every turn, various business stakeholders are given access to progress made.
 . Business stakeholder engagement from start to finish reduces the risk of the final product not meeting business needs.
 . By using user stories to verify that the products meet requirements, agile development is more likely to produce user friendly products.
