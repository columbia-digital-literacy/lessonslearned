This class is truly valuable to me. Before business school, I worked at Apple (http://www.apple.com) in Silicon Valley, where my major responsibility is to develop iOS operating system. We developed the video processing component, so the external developers such as Netflix or Youtube can run smoothly on our mobile devices. We have generated many APIs for the developers, but we miss the opportunities of seeing how application developers are using these APIs, and how they work with GitHub.  

Through the Digital Literacy classes, I got a much deeper understanding of how engineers in a start-up collaborate on their wonderful websites or applications. 

Right now, we, as a team, are also cooperating on the GitHub to discuss our work, which is a great experience! In the class, I got to understand how to recruit engineers to form a powerful team, considering the start-up culture would be much different from the culture of big firms. The ideas taught in class like how to stimulate the engineers are enlightening to me. Having worked as an engineer before, I could partly understand what every engineer pursues, but preparing psychological ammunition is necessary to partner with a more comprehensive team.

In the future, I will work in the venture capital area, and these classes familiarize me with many start-up concepts, which is a big plus to my work experience at a large firm. It helps me better communicate with the entrepreneurs I will meet in the future.
