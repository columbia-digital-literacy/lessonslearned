This course equipped me with basic technology knowledge for literate communication with engineers, and prompted me to think in an engineer's framework so that I can create mutual understanding for effective communication.

Coming from a consulting background, I used to work with several technology development teams within banks and brokerage firms and acted as project manager of their platform / software development projects. Many times we did not reach agreement because we were not able to think from the other side's perspective. I was frustrated by how long a "minor change" from my eyes could take for the teams to implement and how many times deadlines had to be extended. Now I know that a "just do it" in my eyes may take much more effort on the programmer' side, and it is better for them to tell me the expected delivery date, and I can facilitate them to achieve our mutual target by creating a better working environment and business support. I also learned that it is necessary to motivate programmers with non-engineering values, such as strong sense of ownership, impact from business outcomes, and flexible working styles. 

In addition, it is extremely interesting to learn how programmers collaborate on open source codes. It is through agile software development that great programs are built and improved continuously. Software development is becoming more and more a team effort, and hiring engineers with strong communication skills and teamwork mentality is key. Technical skills aside, being able to explain vision and work process in plain English, and creating codes and documentation that are easy to track are essential success factors of engineers.

Finally, getting on GitHub and experiencing how programmers communicate and cooperate is my biggest highlight of the course! I look forward to continuing using GitHub.
