# Understanding APIs communication journey

+ Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) are ways for two different pieces of software to talk to each other.
+ In other words, APIs are the way for communication between a computer and a computer.
+ A software may sound cool and very intelligent by itself, but Software itself is actually isolated from other softwares and cannot transfer or receive any information without APIs. 
+ By receiving or sending information through APIs, Softwares can actively run their tasks and transfer to the next step of process.
+ Therefore, understanding the journey of API allows us to develop cool and super-convenien features, adding values to customers.
+ Thanks to Prof. Peter Bell, below is an excerpt from his lecture note that shows a very nice example for understanding a journey of API. 
+ For example, if you build a mobile app that shows local restaurants, you'll probably reate some server side software which will provide an API to  your mobile app allowing the app to provide a location and for the server to return a list of local restaurants.
