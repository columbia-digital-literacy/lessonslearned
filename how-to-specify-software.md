<h1> How to Specify Software </h1>
<body>
Here are some of the main tools to use when specifying software to developers:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>Wireframes</li>
    An image or set of images which displays the functional elements of a website or page, typically used for planning a site's structure and functionality
  <li>Comps</li>
    Don't be afraid to show other people's websites that you would like yours to look or function like
  <li>User Stories</li>
    You can structure this as: As a<b>role</b>, I want a<b>feature</b>, so that<b>benefit</b>
  <li>Sharing business goals</li>
    Be clear about your business goals, such as increased customer engagement, so that everyone is on the same page
</ul>

When specifying, it is important to understand the tradeoff between cost and time.
Communicate what is most important to your developers. 
Fix bid, fix spec doesn’t work unless the project scope is super small. 
Also, don’t be afraid to sit down and have a discussion and hear what the developer says. 
Finally, there is no such thing as perfect code, remain flexible and understand what is good enough.
