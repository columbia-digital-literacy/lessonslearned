In digital literacy, I've learned about the different ways technology can disrupt traditional business models. Disruption is a trendy buzzword right now,  but it's impact
on current businesses and social dynamics can be profound.

“A disruptive technology is one that displaces an established technology and shakes up the industry or a ground-breaking product that 
creates a completely new industry.” (Source: http://uncubed.com/blog/digital-technology-enables-disruption/)

In class, we discussed the different types of disruption, which includes:

Access long tail
Algorithms
Authentication
Network effects
Business Model
Reliable/Consistent
UI/UX/Mobile
NLP/AI
Dynamic demand/supply response  – More efficient connections
Traffic routing
Crowd sourcing
Sharing 
Personalization
Block Chain decentralized technologies
Disappearing data (snapchat)

We deep-dived into a few more specific examples that included Amazon, Google, Facebook, Netflix, and Uber.

Amazon replaced Borders Books and succeeded by long-tail strategy of offering an almost unlimited number of products.
Google replaced Alta Vista/Yahoo/Ask Jeeves by their unique search algorithm.
Facebook replaced Friendster/Myspace though their real person authentication and powerful network effects.
Netflix replaced Blockbuster through its long-tail and no fee structure.
Uber replaced taxis and car ownership by offering cheaper, safe, more reliable, and convenient transportation service.
