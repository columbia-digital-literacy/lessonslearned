How to Filter Programmers
There are a variety of ways to evaluate potential programmers you want to work with. Some ways are more explicit 
demonstrations of the programmer's skills, while others are more nuanced questions to understand how the programmer thinks and
what kind of experience he/she has. 

One way to determine whether a programmer has the skills you want is to ask him/her how they would build your product. You can
ask to see the programmer's portfolio to see the type of work that he/she has done in the past and see if it aligns with your desired 
look and functionality. You can also administer a coding test, although this filtering method is risky because experienced candidates 
may be offended by being asked to do such a menial task. This potential issue can be mitigated by paying the candidate to do the coding 
test. 

It is also important to ask candidates targeted questions that shed light on their mindset and experience. One basic question everyone
should ask revolves around other commitments the candidate may have. Depending on the time you will require from the programmer, a good
general rule is that a programmer's commitments should not exceed 60 hours per week total. You should also ask a series of questions:
"What X do you use? What do you compare it with? Why select X?" In this case, "X" should be a Version Control System, Unit Test Tool, and
Framework. By asking these three questions with regard to these three components, you can uncover a lot of information about a programmer
and how knowledgeable he/she is. Finally, another way to filter programmers is to get recommendations from current developers.
