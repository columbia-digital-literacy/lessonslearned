When considering building a software program or website it is critical to avoid trying to do too much before releasing a product.
It is advisable to "bootstrap" or release what is called a Minimum Viable Product ("MVP") in order to get a sense of product market fit and product potential.
This strategy helps managers to waste as little money as possible avoiding dumping time and money into a project that may not have potential. 
The key to this is ensuring the manager and developers do enough to have a consumer facing product that can do the job of determining user interest.
Developers may choose to spend more time on the front end and design aspects and spend less time on the back end of the product. 
To the consumer this makes the product look built out and can allow them to interact with the system and perhaps provide their email address or sign up in some way. 
On the back end there may not be a sophisticated software product but it will be enough to determine whether or not to spend more money and time on the venture. 
For eCommerce sites a great solution is to utilize the Shopify platform to build a site for cheap that can function at a high level with limited developer input.
Shopify is a great way to "bootstrap" an eCommerce site and may even be a viable approach for many small to medium size businesses. 
Some issues with these bootstrapping and MVP type approaches is that if your company gets traction it can be a scramble to catch up on the development side.
There are scenarios where consumers have a lot of interest and it basically shuts your site down. 
This can put you in position where you have reputational risk. 
The real reason this is a better strategy though is because many ventures do fail so spending a lot of money and time on them often ends up being a waste.
