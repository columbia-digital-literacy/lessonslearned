# Website or App? What's better for first timers?

[Here's detailed information on the subject](http://www.hswsolutions.com/services/mobile-web-development/mobile-website-vs-apps/) which I've summarized below.

This takeaway from the Digital Literacy class describes the benefits of starting off with using a website versus a mobile app. There are several reasons to do so:

- A website has more reach and takes less effort to create. 
-	It is accessible on all devices without making customized experiences.
-	Further, it would be easier and cheaper to find developers to create the website rather than an app that can be used on all devices.
-	It is also easier for eventual users/consumers to access through a URL, as there is no need to go through the bureaucracy of the App Store or Google Play. This also makes it much easier and quicker to market without having to meet the requirements of the relevant platformâ€™s app store.
-	A website is simpler to build and can do almost the same job as an app. However, it is important to make sure that it is mobile compatible to enable access across platforms.



Hope this helps!
