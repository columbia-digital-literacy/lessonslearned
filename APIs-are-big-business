**Why APIs are a large and growing business**
An API, or application program interface, is a set of protocols and tools allowing software to interact with other software. 
APIs are used by sites to conduct functions externally - either by other companies, or other divisions of a company. APIs can be used to *publish data externally* (e.g., posting something on Facebook), to *process data externally* (e.g., sophisticated analytics), or to *integrate external data* (e.g., tracking shipping status). 
APIs are a form of outsourcing functions that are not the core competency of the business, but are instead common to many businesses. In many respects, they follow a trend towards aggregation online, which we also see with virtualized servers, the sharing economy, and other software-as-a-service (SAAS) products. Because there are enormous economies of scale to writing and running software, such aggregation makes economic sense. Nevertheless, companies must be careful not to expose their core competencies unnecessarily to third parties. 
APIs are spreading quickly both for online and traditional businesses. Pundits predict that in 2016, "APIs will continue their march towards ubiquity", as described in [this article](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3013051/apis/in-2016-apis-will-march-toward-ubiquity.html). Anecdotally, we have seen APIs such as Stripe proliferate across e-commerce sites, allowing them to take credit card payments securely without having to route the transaction through the company's own servers. Many other such features can be imagined, as we did in class with the user-story exercise.
