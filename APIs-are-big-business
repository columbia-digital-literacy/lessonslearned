**Why APIs are a large and growing business**
An API, or application program interface, is a set of protocols and tools allowing software to interact. 
APIs are used by sites to conduct functions externally. APIs can be used to *publish data externally* (e.g., posting something on Facebook), to *process data externally* (e.g., sophisticated analytics), or to *integrate external data* (e.g., tracking shipping status).
APIs are a form of outsourcing functions that are not the core competency of the business, but are instead common to many businesses. In many respects, they follow a trend towards aggregation online, which we also see with virtualized servers, the sharing economy, and other SAAS products. Because there are enormous economies of scale to writing and running software, such aggregation makes economic sense. Nevertheless, companies must be careful not to expose their core competencies unnecessarily to third parties. 
APIs are proliferating quickly both for online and traditional businesses. For example, this article predicts that in 2016, "APIs will continue their march towards ubiquity": <http://www.infoworld.com/article/3013051/apis/in-2016-apis-will-march-toward-ubiquity.html>.
