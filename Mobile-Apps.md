#Mobile Apps - 3 Types to Consider (Hybrid, Cross Platform, Native)
#Hybrid:
  Ex: PhoneGap - Free open source software to bundle code for appstore.
  Advantages of Hybrid Apps: Can leverage existing web content and resources, single codebase across devices, lowest cost option
  Disadvantages of Hybrid Apps: Limited functionality to take advantage of advanced smartphone hardware features
  Timeframe/Cost: Simple App 3-6 months, $10K
#Cross Platform:
  Framework Examples: Appcelerator (java), Xamarin (.net, c#)
  Advantages of Cross Platform Apps: Single code base for all platforms, most cost effective for multiple platforms, deep hardware integration, compiles to native, fairly quick to market, great for corporate type applications.
  Disadvantages of Cross Platform Apps: Might require licensing fees, less flexibility with UI/UX as compared to native, lag time for native hardware features, not good for games.
  Timeframe/Cost: Simple App 6 months, $10-$50k
#Native:
  Ex: Swift, Jave
  Advantages of Native Apps: Highest performance, can take full advantage of hardware and 3rd party integration, future proof - can continue to rework existing code, only real option for gaming / imersive experiences.
  Disadvantages of Native Apps: Most expensive option, deed separate development teams for each platform (IOS, Android)
  
  # Example of application
  Let's suppose you want to build a game with rich local functionality like this one:

In this case, you would clearly go for a native app. You need rich use of graphics and a very personaly designed application. Once you have decided to go build a native app, you have to prioritize whether to start on iOS or Android. This article gives a list of pros and cons on each of them!
