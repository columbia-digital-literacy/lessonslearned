#Approaches For Building An App

When building a mobile app, there are three possible approaches you can follow: Hybrid, Cross Plaform, and Native. The choice you make depends on multiple factors regarding your mobile app needs (e.g., number of platforms, functions required, speed to market, desired performance level, type of UX/UI, budget).

<strong>Hybrid</strong>
 - Pros
   - Least expensive of the three approaches 
   - Can leverage existing web content (e.g., HTML, JS, CSS)
   - Can use a single cade base across all platforms (e.g., Android, iOS) 
   - Looks similar to a native app
   - Works well for content driven apps
   - Quickest to market
 - Cons
   - Hardware feature functionality is not at the level of the other two approaches (e.g., issues with video processing)
   - Less flexibility with user interface
   - Slower performance vs. native

<strong>Cross-Platform</strong>
 - Pros
   - Takes hybrid approach but lets you integrate with the hardware of the phone a bit more
   - Can use a single code base across all platforms (e.g., Android, iOS) 
   - Requires less customization for different platforms 
 - Cons
   - Offers less flexibiltiy with UX / UI
   - Has a bit of a lag time for native hardware features
   - Might require licensing fees

<strong>Native</strong>
 - Pros
   - Full advantage of hardware and third party integration 
   - Is future proof - code you will build out on a native device can easily be adopted for future versions
   - Provides the best experience for gaming
 - Cons
   - Most expensive of the three approaches
   - Requires a separate development team for each platform (e.g., Android, iOS) with very little carry over
   - Takes a little bit more time to get to market
   - Need to constantly modify and support the latest as each platform goes through version upgrades
