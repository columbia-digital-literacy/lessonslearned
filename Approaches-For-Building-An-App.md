#Approaches For Building An App

Hybrid
 - Pros
   - Least expensive of the three approaches 
   - Can leverage existing web content (e.g., HTML, JS, CSS)
   - Can use a single cade base across all platforms (e.g., Android, iOS) 
   - Looks similar to a native app
   - Works well for content driven apps
 - Cons
   - Hardware feature functionality is not at the level of the other two approaches (e.g., issues with video processing)
   - Less flexibility with user interface
   - Slower performance vs. native

Cross-Platform
 - Pros
   - Takes hybrid approach but lets you integrate with the hardware of the phone a bit more
   - Can use a single code base across all platforms (e.g., Android, iOS) 
   - Requires less customization for different platforms (e.g., Android, iOS)
 - Cons
   - Offers less flexibiltiy with UX / UI
   - Has a bit of a lag time for native hardware features
   - Might require liscensing fees

Native
 - Pros
   - Full advantage of hardware and third party integration 
   - Is future proof - code you will build out on a native device can easily be adopted for future versions
   - Provides the best experience for gaming
 - Cons
   - Most expensive of the three approaches
   - Requires a separate development team for each platform (e.g., Android, iOS) with very little carry over
   - Takes a little bit more time to get to market
