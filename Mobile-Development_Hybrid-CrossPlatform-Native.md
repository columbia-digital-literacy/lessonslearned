#Mobile Application Development

The process of developing a mobile application differs a bit from creating a standard website.
Although a site is often the best way to start in order to maximize reach and simplicity and minimize time to market and cost, eventually a mobile solution is likely to be necessary.
Each of the following 3 approaches to creating applications has pros and cons that make it suited for different situations.


##Hybrid Application Development
Uses web programming languages in a set tool to create a standalone mobile application

**Pros**: Can leverage existing web content, uses a single code base across devices, has the quickest time to market

**Cons**: Limited functionality for hardware features, less flexibility with user interface, and slower performance

**Best for**: content-driven applications (e.g. news) and/or those that need to be made quickly and cheaply

**Example**: The Khan Academy

##Cross-Platform Application Development
Uses specific web programming languages that can then be translated into files that can be read on different mobile platforms using a tool like Appcelerator or PhoneGap. You can find comparisons of 5 cross-platform tools [here](http://www.developereconomics.com/pros-cons-top-5-cross-platform-tools/)

**Pros**: Single code base, more cost effective for multiple platforms than native programming, allows for deep hardware integration, quicker to market than native application

**Cons**: Might require a licensing fee, less flexibility with user interface and user experience than native programming, will require lag time to integrate many native hardware features

**Best for**: Standard application types (e.g. shopping) and/or those that need more integration than Hybrid but perhaps with a shorter time frame or smaller budget than a native

**Example**: Disney World Dining Planner

##Native Application Development
Uses languages specifically developed for each platform to create applications for each platform (for example: separately developed iOs and Android applications)

**Pros**: Best performance, can take full advantage of hardware and third party integration, future-proof (operating system updates, for example), the only option for games and other immersive applications

**Cons**: Most expensive, slowest to market, and requires a team for each platform

**Best for**: Immersive applications (e.g.games) and/or applications that will benefit from integration with hardware that have enough time and budget to build it

**Example**: Instagram
