When specifying software, managers (without a coding background) may be tempted to go for the 'Big Design Upfront' (BDU) approach.
The problem with BDU is that for the entire project you rely on information you had at the start of the project and not on subsequent learning. 
This implies that your software will be based on knowledge from the least knowledgeable part of the project - you're locking in ignorance. 
Furthermore, it will be difficult for a programmer to influence any outcomes when the final outcome has already been planned out in detail.
One risk is that at the end of the project, when the software is completed, it no longer fits the direction the rest of the company has taken in the meantime.
BDU also requires upfront planning including budgets and project timelines, which can cost money and waste valuable developer time.

Incremental software development solves many of the issues you can encounter with BDU. 
First of all it is more flexible and can respond to changes much quicker. Small changes are added quickly and costly mistakes can be avoided. 
Another benefit of incremental software development is that you have a series of mini milestones in each iteration, which can improve team morale and create good momentum as each milestone is reached.
Another big advantage of using the incremental software development approach is that developers can show you part of the software at the time. 
Seeing and testing the software along the way (working software) is both cost and time efficient and will be much easier when developing something incrementally. 
Test-driven development can also be a key part of incremental software development - the two can be integrated.
