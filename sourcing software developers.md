Below, I have described a number of ways that 'business-people' can try to source software developers to work on their projects.

1. Ask other developers 
  * This is probably the best approach
  * They will hopefully have an understanding of who is involved in the developer community, presents at meetups, etc.
2. Post on a mailing list (possibly one distributed through certain meetups)
3. Look at the credits of good websites / software (this is a less common approach nowadays, as credits aren't common to see)
4. Use services that provide access to freelancers (upwork, rent a coder, elance, guru, etc.)
5. Go to universities and ask members of relevant clubs or post on jobs/message board at computer science school
6. Go to meetups for the relevant technology
  * If taking this approach, be careful not to come across as a 'vulture' who is just looking for engineers
  * Dress casually and ask people if they know others who might be interesting in working on a type of project (for $), rather than asking them to work for you
  * [Link to a popular meetup site](https://www.meetup.com)
